# hacky-holidays ☆.ᐟ

## overview
this is my submission for hack club's winter ysws "hacky holidays" where we had to create a pcb for a christmas ornament / decorative item. my project is of an ornament with multiple neopixels that **changes color based on time of day and month of the year**. 
<br><Br>
this adopts a color scheme that is inspired by various albums by taylor swift in different genres sung in different styles about different themes which all represent a particular color as recognized by the global fanbase. 

## schematic
i started out with easyeda but ended up using kicad 8.0 for making the pcb

## pcb
kicad developers i will pay you an ungodly amount of money to add an auto-routing feature (jk this one was super simple, nothing compared to the hackpad).

## firmware
the firmware for this is written in arduino.
